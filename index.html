 <h1>Welcome To The Ice Age</h1>

 <p>It is the year 2134 and its been 30 years since an Ice Age came upon Earth. Most city's are now snow lands and many died when the Ice Age first hit, but in the present many people have gone and built settlements all over the world and you are a bounty hunter that had come to the state of Oregon in order to hunt down one of your contracts. When you last heard from a man that he was recently seen near a city call Stadium City. You are off to the city when you take a short break and while sleeping by the fire you get captured and tied up and hours later you wake up.</p>
